Since there are 6 workers, each worker's individual work rate is 1/8/6 = 1/48 of the job per day.\n\n2. Now, the 6 workers have worked for 3 days, so they have completed 3*1/48 = 3/48 of the job.\n\n3. After 3 days, 4 more workers join them. Now, the combined work rate of all 10 workers is (6+4)*1/48 = 10/48 of the job per day.\n\n4. To find out how many days they need to finish the remaining 3/48 - 3/48 (since they have already done 3/48 of the job) of the job, we divide the remaining work by their combined work rate: (3/48 - 3/48) / (10/48) = 0 days.\n\n5. However, this answer is incorrect because we cannot finish a fraction of a day. Since the work rate increased significantly with the addition of the 4 workers, the remaining time should be less than 3 days.\n\n6. To find the correct answer, we subtract the time the original 6 workers took to complete 1/48 of the job from the remaining work: 1/48 - (3/48 - 3/48) = 1/48.\n\n7.

In this case, the volume is 6 cm * 5 cm * 2 cm = 60 cubic cm.\n2. Now, we need to find the new volume after a 19% decrease. We can do this by finding 81% of the original volume (since 100% - 19% = 81%) and then subtracting it from the original volume.\n3. So, the new volume is 60 cubic cm * 0.81 = 48.6 cubic cm (rounded to two decimal places).\n4. Since the thickness remains the same, we can now focus on finding the new length and width. Let x be the percentage decrease in length and y be the percentage decrease in width.\n5. We know that the original volume is 60 cubic cm and the new volume is 48.6 cubic cm. We also know that the original length is 6 cm, the original width is 5 cm, and the thickness is 2 cm.\n6. Using these relationships, we can set up two equations:\n   - Original volume = 6 * 5 * 2\n   - New volume = (6 - x) * (5 - y) * 2\n7. Solving these equations, we get:\n   - 60 = 6 * 5 * 2\n   - 48.6 = (6 - x) * (5 - y) * 2\n8. Simplifying the second equation, we get:\n   - 24.3 = (6 - x) * (5 - y)\n9. Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables (x and y). We can solve this system using various methods, but a simple approach is to guess and check.\n10. Since the new volume is smaller, both x and y must be positive numbers. Let's start by trying small values for x and y and see if we can find a solution that satisfies both equations.\n11. For example, if we try x = 0.2 (a 20% decrease in length) and y = 0.1 (a 10%",

Since she breaks the branch along all the markings, the number of pieces she gets is the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of thirds and fifths, which is 30 (LCM(15, 25) = 30).\n\n3. Kim removes one piece of every distinct length, which means for each third, she removes one piece, and for each fifth, she removes one piece.\n\n4. To find out how many pieces remain, we subtract the number of pieces she removed from the total number of pieces:\n   Remaining pieces = Total pieces - Pieces removed\n   = 30 - (15 thirds pieces + 5 fifths pieces)\n   = 30 - (15 + 5 * 3) (since one third is equal to 3 fifths)\n   = 30 - 20 * 3\n   = 30 - 60\n   = -30\n\n5. Since the number of remaining pieces is negative, it means that all pieces have been removed, and nothing remains. However, the question asks for a fraction of the original branch, not the number of pieces.\n\n6. To find the fraction of the original branch that remains, we can divide the length of the remaining branch by the total length of the original branch:\n   Fraction = Remaining length / Original length\n   = 0 / 5\n   = 0\n\n7.

Since a and b are the tens and units digits, they can form a number divisible by 15 if they are of the form 3x or 5x.\n\n3.
