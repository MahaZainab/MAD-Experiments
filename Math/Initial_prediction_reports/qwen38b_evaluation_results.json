      "rationale": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given the banker's gain (BG) of a certain sum due 3 years hence at 10% per annum is Rs. 36. We need to find the present worth (PW).\n\nStep 2: Recall the formulas related to banker's gain\nBanker's Gain (BG) is the difference between the amount due at maturity and the present worth. It can also be calculated using the formula:\n\nBG = (PW \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time\u00b2) / (100 \u00d7 (1 + (Rate \u00d7 Time)/100))\n\nAlternatively, another formula for BG is:\n\nBG = (Interest on the present worth for the time period at the given rate)\n\nWait, but I think I need to recall the exact formula for Banker's Gain. Let me think again.\n\nActually, Banker's Gain is the difference between the true discount (TD) and the banker's discount (BD). But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: \n\nBanker's Gain (BG) is the interest on the present worth for the time period at the given rate. So, BG = (PW \u00d7 R \u00d7 T) / 100\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, the Banker's Gain is calculated as the difference between the Banker's Discount (BD) and the True Discount (TD). \n\nBD is the simple interest on the face value (FV) for the time period at the given rate.\n\nTD is the simple interest on the present worth (PW) for the time period at the given rate.\n\nBG = BD - TD\n\nBut since FV = PW + TD, we can express BD as the simple interest on (PW + TD) for the same time period and rate.\n\nBut this might get complicated. However, there's a direct formula for BG in terms of PW, rate, and time.\n\nWait, let me check if there is a formula that directly relates BG to PW, rate, and time. \n\nAnother way to think: \n\nBanker's Gain is the interest on the True Discount for the time period. So, BG = (TD \u00d7 R \u00d7 T) / 100\n\nBut TD is (PW \u00d7 R \u00d7 T) / 100, so BG would be [(PW \u00d7 R \u00d7 T)/100 \u00d7 R \u00d7 T]/100 = (PW \u00d7 R\u00b2 \u00d7 T\u00b2)/10000\n\nWait",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nLet the original number of students in the school be $ x $.\n\nThe average age of these students is 40 years, so the total age of all the original students is $ 40x $.\n\nNow, 120 new students with an average age of 32 years join the school.

      "rationale": "Let me try to solve this problem step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. There's a train that's 125 meters long, and it passes a man who is running in the same direction as the train. The man's speed is 15 km/hr, and it takes the train 10 seconds to pass him. I need to find the speed of the train.\n\nOkay, so when the train is passing the man, it's effectively covering its own length relative to the man. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the train with respect to the man is the difference between their speeds. \n\nLet me recall the formula for relative speed. If two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference of their speeds. So if the train's speed is Vt and the man's speed is Vm, then the relative speed is Vt - Vm. \n\nThe train has to cover its own length, which is 125 meters, at this relative speed to completely pass the man. The time taken for this is given as 10 seconds. \n\nSo, using the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time. Here, the distance is 125 meters, the speed is (Vt - Vm), and the time is 10 seconds. \n\nBut wait, the units need to be consistent. The man's speed is given in km/hr, and the time is in seconds. I need to convert either the speed to m/s or the time to hours. Let me convert the man's speed to m/s. \n\nTo convert km/hr to m/s, we multiply by 1000/3600, which simplifies to 5/18. \n\nSo, Vm = 15 km/hr = 15 \u00d7 (5/18) m/s = (75/18) m/s = 4.1667 m/s approximately. \n\nAlternatively, I can convert the time to hours, but that might be more complicated. Let me stick with converting the man's speed to m/s. \n\nSo, the relative speed (Vt - Vm) is equal to distance divided by time. \n\nSo, (Vt - Vm) = 125 m / 10 s = 12.5 m/s. \n\nTherefore, Vt = 12.5 m/s + Vm.",

So, the question is about covering a rectangular floor with carpet squares and finding the total cost. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the floor is 15 meters by 18 meters. I need to find the area of the floor. Area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, right? So that would be 15 times 18. Let me calculate that. 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 8 is 120, so adding those together gives 150 + 120 = 270 square meters. Okay, so the floor's area is 270 m\u00b2.\n\nNext, each carpet square is 3 meters by 3 meters. So the area of one square is 3 times 3, which is 9 square meters. Got that. So each square covers 9 m\u00b2.\n\nNow, to find out how many squares are needed to cover the entire floor, I should divide the total area of the floor by the area of one square. That would be 270 divided by 9. Let me do that division. 270 divided by 9... Well, 9 times 30 is 27",

The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15, so we can convert the branch length to fifteenths of a meter for easier calculation. The branch is 5 meters long, which is 75/15 meters.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the positions of the markings. For thirds, the positions are at 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 (which is 1) of the branch. For fifths, the positions are at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, and 5/5 (which is 1) of the branch. Converting these to fifteenths:\n\n- Thirds: 1/3 = 5/15, 2/3 = 10/15, 3/3 = 15/15\n- Fifths: 1/5 = 3/15, 2/5 = 6/15, 3/5 = 9/15, 4/5 = 12/15, 5/5 = 15/15\n\nSo the markings are at 3/15, 5/15, 6/15, 9/15, 10/15, 12/15, and 15/15 (but 15/15 is the end of the branch, so we don't count it as a marking). Thus, the markings are at 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12 fifteenths.\n\nStep 4: Sort the markings and determine the lengths of the pieces. The markings are at 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12 fifteenths. Adding the start (0) and end (15) of the branch, the pieces are:\n\n- 0 to 3: 3/15\n-",

Since there are 6 pots, the costs would be:\n\nx, x + 0.10, x + 0.20, x + 0.30, x + 0.40, x + 0.50\n\nThe total cost is $8.25, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (x + 0.10) + (x + 0.20) + (x + 0.30) + (x + 0.40) + (x + 0.50) = 8.25\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n6x + (0.10 + 0.20 + 0.30 + 0.40 + 0.50) = 8.25\n\nCalculating the sum of the constants:\n\n0.10 + 0.20 + 0.30 + 0.40 + 0.50 = 1.50\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n6x + 1.50 = 8.25\n\nSubtracting 1.50 from both sides:\n\n6x = 8.25 - 1.50 = 6.75\n\nDividing both sides by 6:\n\nx = 6.75 / 6 = 1.125\n\nSo the cost of the smallest pot is $1.125. The largest pot is x + 0.50, which is:\n\n1.125 + 0.50 = 1.625\n\nBut since the answer options are in dollars and cents, we need to round to the nearest cent. However, the exact value is $1.625, which is $1.63. But none of the options are $1.63. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's check again. The sum of the constants is 0.10 + 0.20 + 0.30 + 0.40 + 0.50 = 1.50. Then 6x + 1",

A number is divisible by 45 if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit (the units digit, b) is either 0 or 5. Therefore, b can be either 0 or 5.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. In this case, the number has digits a (tens) and b (units). Therefore, the sum of the digits is a + b, and this must be a multiple of 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of b:\n\n- If b = 0:\n  - The sum of the digits is a + 0 = a. For the number to be divisible by 9, a must be a multiple of 9.\n  - Since a is a digit (0-9), the possible values of a are 0 or 9.\n  - The product b x a = 0 x a = 0 in both cases.\n\n- If b = 5:\n  - The sum of the digits is a + 5. For the number to be divisible by 9, a + 5 must be a multiple of 9.\n  - The possible values for a are such that a + 5 is 9 or 18 (since a is a digit between 0 and 9, the maximum a + 5 can be is 14).\n  - So, a + 5 = 9 \u2192 a = 4\n  - a + 5 = 18 \u2192 a = 13 (not a valid digit)\n  - Therefore, the only valid value is a = 4.\n  - The product b x a = 5 x 4 = 20.\n\nComparing the products:\n- When b = 0, the product is 0.\n- When b = 5, the product is 20.\n\nThus, the greatest possible value of b x a is 20.\n\nFinal answer: e\n1. **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - **Divisibility by 5**: The number must end in 0 or 5, so",
